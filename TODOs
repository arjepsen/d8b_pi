- Where do we set ch-strip1 select on boot?

- messages & commands are sent and received as char strings, so there is a conversion from value to string.
Where is the best place to convert? Just before sending? or saved value in objects?

- if initscript is succesfull, close settings window.

- Channelstrips and master strip has some comboboxes, where the selected plugin is listed in a label above the combobox, instead of IN the combobox. (f.ex the Master L/R inserts.) Either we stay with standard combobox functionality, or we edit it so the combobox always shows "INSERT R", and the chosen item is shown in the label....

- Maybe the communications can be made a bit more robust? Maybe do more with the information -1, 0 and 1 returned as number of read chars?

- DSP message lookup table and handlers

- MixerManager buffer message handler - we need to handle messages according to chosen bank. 
What's smartest: Seperate methods for each bank, or one method, that checks bank selection for every single message?

- Setting volume for master fader is a command like: 4Cc9XC1QAXC1Q for unity.
This might be seperated like: 4Cc - 9XyyQ - AXyyQ, with yy being the volume value.
Check the truth of this, if pan is used.
handle different volume levels for L/R.


-ChannelIDMap.... should they all be constants? How are we using them?

-Considering changing channel and channelstrip ID's to C-style strings, instead of std::strings... 
Maybe wait for now, to see how performance is.

-Set up "banking", so various function, like handling fader move, sends dsp commands depending on selected bank.

-optimize - remove various debug messages, remove debug variables like msgcount in the circular buffer.

- change initialize procedure, so the window closes when init is successful.

-setVolume in MasterChannelClass - check if there is a case where we update the volume member, without sending to dsp... (like mute...)

- really test circular buffer size.

- change various constructors, to be able to initialize the setup from a given saved configuration.


- Is there a mute function for the Master ? It could be implemented same as for channels, but is it there originally?




NEXT TO WORK ON: pan pots. Might need to work on the master channel stuff that changes what those does first??



.at() are used in several places over operator[], for boundschecking safety.
Check it through, and see if any place can be optimized for the []
