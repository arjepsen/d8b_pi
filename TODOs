- Where do we set ch-strip1 select on boot?

- messages & commands are sent and received as char strings, so there is a conversion from value to string.
Where is the best place to convert? Just before sending? or saved value in objects?

- if initscript is succesfull, close settings window.

- Channelstrips and master strip has some comboboxes, where the selected plugin is listed in a label above the combobox, instead of IN the combobox. (f.ex the Master L/R inserts.) Either we stay with standard combobox functionality, or we edit it so the combobox always shows "INSERT R", and the chosen item is shown in the label....

- Maybe the communications can be made a bit more robust? Maybe do more with the information -1, 0 and 1 returned as number of read chars?
