Essentially the mixer console contains two boards, that has a dsp chip on it:
The Brain board, and the DSP board.

The boards sends messages to the CPU about stuff that happens on the console,
and the CPU sends commands to the boards, when something should happen.
The "CPU" is a term for the computer that handles the graphical interface, and communication with the two boards.

So, if we move a fader, a pot or press a button, a message is sent from the Brain board to the CPU.
Then the CPU would send a message to the DSP board about how to handle the audio...


Overall parts of the program:
One part is displaying a graphical interface.
Another part is handling messages to and from the console.

There is four "banks" in the mixer, so the messages that are sent to and from the mixer, can be dependant on 
the currently selected bank.
So There are several maps of method callbacks set up - one for each bank.
And then a pointer to such a map is used, to handle the current selection.

Then other classes can "subscribe" to an event, by registering a callback with the event bus.

An important challenge here is, that each channelstrip should be configurable, so that any strip in any bank, 
can be configured to handle any specific channel.







Things to explain:
What is a "channel"
What is a bank.
