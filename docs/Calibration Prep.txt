Before the calibration starts - the user is presented with a "do you wish to continue" part.

1)
First we turn off some leds with this line:
476j47Bj47Cj47Dj47Ej4B6j4CCj4C2j4D8j4DEj4D4j4EAj4E0j472j

This turns off:
EQ btn led, Select1-4, any ring led on the EQ pots, and the ON btn led.

2)
Next we clear the display by writing spaces over any text in there.
(Maybe there is a quicker command for this?)
83u20v20v20v20v8Du20v20v20v20v97u20v20v20v20vA1u20v20v20v20vA7u20vC2u20v20v20vC6u20v20vCCu20v20v20vD0u20v20vD6u20v20v20vDAu20v20vE0u20v20v20vE4u20v20v

3)
Now, the next thing that happens, is this command:
47Ek
This makes the fourth Select button led blink. (cancel)

4)
this command:
47Di
turns on the led in the third Select button. (OK)

5)
Last, this command:
80u43v61v6Cv69v62v72v61v74v65v8Au66v61v64v65v72v90u6Dv6Fv74v6Fv72v73v3Fv99u41v72v65v9Du79v6Fv75vA1u73v75v72v65v3FvD8u4Fv4BvE0u43v61v6Ev63v65v6Cv
writes to the display:
"Calibrate fader motors? Are you sure?"
"                       OK      Cancel"
