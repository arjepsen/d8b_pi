Below is a description of the first band of the 4-band parametric EQ

When a parameter (Gain, Frequency or Q) is changed, a 20-byte hex value is sent 
to the DSP board. This value represents the coefficients for a "bi-quad" fir filter.
(see: https://webaudio.github.io/Audio-EQ-Cookbook/audio-eq-cookbook.html)

20-byte message  =  5 × 32-bit words
                     └─ big-endian, most-significant byte first
                     └─ each word is a signed fixed-point number
                        in **Q4.28** format:  1 sign | 3 integer | 28 fraction bits
                     └─ order =  b0  b1  b2  a1  a2
(a0 is not sent, since we "normalize" so that a0 = 1 )


(so mathwise we have:)
y[n] = b0·x[n] + b1·x[n−1] + b2·x[n−2] − a1·y[n−1] − a2·y[n−2]

Anyways, it is worth noting, that the internal sample-rate also plays a part here. According to chatgpt, the desk uses 47027 Hz - not 48000 precisely....
(something about the crystal and stuff....)

Anyways, we have these equations:

A     = 10^(G / 40)               # √(10^(dB/20))
ω0    = 2π · F / Fs
α     = sin ω0 / (2Q)
cosω  = cos ω0

b0 = 1 + α·A
b1 = −2·cos ω0
b2 = 1 − α·A
a0 = 1 + α/A
a1 = −b1                     # *** sign flipped vs textbook ***
a2 = −(1 − α/A)              # *** sign flipped vs textbook ***

# normalise so a0 = 1
b0, b1, b2, a1, a2  ←  divide each of them by a0

The sign gets flipped, becuase it seems that the chip stores the feedback coefficients woth opposite sign in relation to RBJ's cookbok.

Now, each normalized coefficient gets converted to signed Q4.28 format
and then they are packed into the 20-byte value.
