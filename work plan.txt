physcial / UI fader interaction. - WORKING.

Next, get the master fader up and running.

Then start working on buttons. (maybe wait with pans untill banks are implemented?)



VPOTS - on master section:
Create a new class; MasterSectionClass.
In it's instantiation, it should register/subscribe it's callbacks for the master section vpots.
These needs to be registered in/for all four banks. The fader callback should be null.
Then also change the callback structure for how to handle the buttons.



BUTTONS:
Tricky thing - we have implemented the eventPost with parameters for channel strip ID, but the buttons 
send their unique id, plus an s/u.
So how do we best identify the right channel to handle the button press?
